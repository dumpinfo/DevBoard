Cadsoft Eagle PCB interface to Electra
Copyright (c) 2003-2006 by KONEKT SPRL, all rights reserved
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This interface is for Eagle v4.1

Main features of the bi-directional interface:

* GUI based routing strategy and rules constraints
* User definable routing layers, preferred direction, layer type and usage cost
* Reads native Eagle DRC rules from the DRU file
* Supports Eagle Net classes with pre-defined width, clearance and drill size
* Set clearance between object type of wire, via, pin, smd pad and board outline
* Set wiring rules (via at smd, same net minimum gap, ...)
* Fanout parameters
* Max limits (bends, vias, crossings...)
* Automatic save and restore of the defined rules
* Handles Eagle restricted regions (wire and via keepouts)
* Converts power planes for autorouting
* Supports Eagle pre-routed wires and vias by protected them


Translation from CadSoft/EagleTM to Electra Autorouter
=======================================================


1) Start EAGLE Layout Editor and load your board file. 

2) Execute PCB_To_DSN.ulp either by typing in the RUN command in the command line of EAGLE Layout Editor, 
or by selecting the icon ULP and choosing PCB_To_DSN.ulp in a dialog window presented. You can also assign a shortcut 
under Options/Assign to run the script, the value assign to a key would be for example: 
  
	run <Electra_install_directory>\Eagle\PCB_To_DSN.ulp

Note: PCB_To_DSN.ulp is located under the <Electra_install_directory>\Eagle\PCB_To_DSN.ulp 

3) Choose the location on your hard disk, where the <board.dsn> file should be saved. 

4) From the ELECTRA setup dialog, set the routing strategy and click OK when done.

5) Start Electra, load the <board.dsn>, you are now ready to autoroute your board. 



Translation from Electra to CadSoft/EagleTM
===========================================


1) From Electra, invoke the menu File / Export / Script..., this will generate a script file with the routed wires and vias. 
Choose the location on your hard disk, where the <board.scr> file should be saved. 

2) In the EAGLE Layout Editor, execute <board.scr> file either by typing in the SCR command in the command line 
of EAGLE Layout Editor, or by selecting the icon SCR and choosing <board.scr> in a dialog window presented. 


Note: To invoke PCB_To_DSN.ulp from the Eagle control panel, you just need to copy PCB_To_DSN.ulp to 
the <Eagle_install_directory>\ulp folder.
